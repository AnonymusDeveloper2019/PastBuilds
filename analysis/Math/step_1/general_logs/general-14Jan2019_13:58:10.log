HEAD is now at 7cac17f... MATH-797 Initial version for Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules: the integration is performed on the whole interval using a single rule. [Whereas the approach used in class "analysis.integration.LegendreGaussIntegrator" is to divide iteratively into sub-intervals (over which the integration rule is used) until some covergence criterion is met.] Adapted from an original code donated by Sébastien Brisard. In the current implementation, the Gauss-Legendre rules are computed in double precision in "LegendreRuleFactory" and high precision (using "java.math.BigDecimal") in "LegendreHighPrecisionRuleFactory". However, the "GaussIntegrator" class performs the integration using "double"s whatever the precision of the rule. The framework of "BaseRuleFactory" enables the addition of other quadrature schemes (by overriding the "computeRule" method). [Sébastien's code already provides Gauss-Chebyshev and Gauss-Hermite schemes (in double precision).]

Previous HEAD position was 287f41b... MATH-650 Suggesting to use "resource" files for storing large tables. "FastMathResource" is a utility for creating and loading those resources. "FastMathLoadCheck" modified to allow the benchmarking of the various ways to create the tables needed in "FastMath". "FastMathResourcesSave" shows how to create the resource files (not a "user" functionality, as this should be done only once): The resource files have been created and are located under "src/main/resources/data".

[ BUILD CHECKER ] 74ff198 commit gona be checked
Previous HEAD position was 816bbc0... Added reference to issue MATH-439.
HEAD is now at 74ff198... MATH-439 Refactored the "solvers" package. Implementations refer to number of evaluation of the objective function (instead of the number of iterations). New interfaces and base classes. "NewtonSolver" fits in the design without resorting to a cast. Created class "MullerSolver2" to contain the code of the method named "solve2" in class "MullerSolver". Removed "UnivariateRealSolverFactory" and "UnivariateRealSolverFactoryImpl". Default solver in "UnivariateRealSolverUtils" is explicitely instantiated. "AbstractContinuousDistribution": Type of exception thrown changed in "UnivariateRealSolverUtils". Factored out duplicate code (in "GaussNewtonOptimizerTest" and "LevenbergMarquardtOptimizerTest"): class "Circle" is now called "CircleVectorial". Also factored out the "Circle" class from "NonLinearConjugateGradientOptimizerTest": class is named "CircleScalar". Created "SecantSolverTest", moving there all the tests for the class "SecantSolver" that were located in class "BrentSolverTest". Created new interface and base class for polynomial functions solvers ("LaguerreSolver") so that the function type is now checked at compile time. Removed deprecated exceptions (MATH-441). Javadoc clean-up. Lowered tolerance values in some unit tests. Tests upgraded to Junit 4 (MATH-423).

HEAD is now at 37fb4b5... removed lots of serialization in ODE the only classes/interfaces for which serialization is really important in this package are the step interpolators. The reason for that is that the ContinuousOutputModel is explicitly serializable and contains step interpolators. This allows users to perform integration of any complex model and to save the result of the integration for all integration range by serializing a ContinuousOutputModel instance. This feature is a major one.

[ BUILD CHECKER ] cc7a071 commit gona be checked
Previous HEAD position was 7b37de8... Improved linear RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl performances. The main changes are the following ones:  - use directly the storage array when possible for    diadic operations (add, subtract, multiply), as    suggested by Phil, this avoids the cost of the    generic getEntry method  - replaced custom indices checks by simple use of    the JVM checks and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException  - put row arrays reference in local variables to    avoid multiple checks in double loops  - use final variables where possible  - removed unneeded array copying  - added a constructor to build a matrix from an    array without copying it where it makes sense

This removes lots of warnings that have appeared after the switch to Java 5, and improves safety (for example the categories used by OneWayAnova are guaranteed to be double arrays at compile time). Two difficult cases where not handled here: the Frequency class and the Fitness interface. The first one mixes types and needs to be studied before any change is attempted. The second one generates some side effects on the overall package which is still under development.
